# Sales_Data_Analysis
This project was done in collaboration with Bhargav Pachouli(@Bhargavakku0.
Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end Sales Data Analysis by combining Pandas, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.
The main objectives were:

To preprocess and structure the sales dataset using Python

To create views using SQL for analysis

To design an interactive dashboard in Power BI leveraging the SQL views

To create a Tableau dashboard directly from the raw dataset for comparison

This project highlights how different BI tools can be used with the same dataset to extract insights, visualize KPIs, and support business decisions.

Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation and Views(Python and PgAdmin)

Loaded the raw sales dataset and performed pre-processing using Python.

Wrote SQL queries to clean, aggregate, and create views for reporting.

These views served as the data source for Power BI.

2. Dashboard in Power BI

Connected Power BI to the SQL database (via the created views).

Built dashboards covering key KPIs:

Total Sales & Revenue trends

Sales by Region, Category, and Month

Top Customers & Products

Profitability insights

3. Dashboard in Tableau

Imported the raw dataset directly into Tableau.

Built a dashboard with similar KPIs for cross-tool comparison.

Focused on:

Sales Distribution by Region & Product

Revenue Trends (time-series)

Profitability Metrics
